## Description

The purpose of this application was to create a text editor and build the project by using progressive web application. The project used multiple packages to help build it including webpack, and babel. The use of workbox to register service workers and help cache assets and other data was also included. Since this application was built on a PWA, it is able to function offline and also be installed as an app.

## Installation

In order to install this application, the user has to press the install button on the top left of the website. From there, a prompt should appear that confirms if you want to install the application on your desktop.

## Usage

To use the application, all you have to do is type or delete anything in the text editor. After you click on anywhere but the text box, the application should automatically save and update whatever was inputted or deleted. The application should also resume where you left off when you reenter the website. The application can also be used when offline, and should update once connection is regained.
